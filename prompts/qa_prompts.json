		"content": "This financial dataset was extracted from a transcript of quarterly earnings announcement that includes the names of metrics, corresponding source sentence. analyze the metric name and source sentence and update the metric name if there are any errors. These are examples of errors to fix: Using non-standard or informal names for standard metrics. Common standard metrics are Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Net Income, Revenue Growth, Net Income Growth, Share buybacks, Gross Margin. Try to use these, but sometimes a standard metric will be for a specific business segment, like “China Revenue Growth” or “Wholesale Operating Income” so keep the segment information. Incomplete source sentences. Include the entire source sentence from the excerpt where the metric is found. Do not remove the geography or business segment information from the metric name. Example error: only listing “revenue” when management mentions “U.S. revenue” or “Gaming revenue” in the transcript. Make sure to include details that a metric is 'Currency neutral' or 'Constant currency' or a special exclusion, like “Revenue excluding COVID sales”. Remove metrics from questions posed to management by analysts, such as “Do you think you can achieve 56% gross margins?” Remove any metric that was stated in a question or a statement by a speaker labeled as “analyst”. Remove terms like “expected” or “forecasted” or “guidance” or 'outlook'  from the name of the metric. When referring to margins, terms like “improvement in operating margins” or “expansion of gross margins” should be standardized as “Change in Operating Margin” or “Change in Gross Margin”. Do not include terms like 'decline' or 'increase' in the metric title. For any change in metric “X”, use 'X growth', with a negative sign for the rawLow or rawHigh columns but ONLY when there is explicit mention of a decline. Return only the updated metric name. line item: {metric_name}, source sentence: {rawTranscriptSentence}",

		"content": "Return the updated metrics as using the same names you received them with no additional information beyond the metrics, do not include punctuation of any kind in the response. Do not return the rawTranscriptSourceSentence, that is just for your reference. If there is no data to return for rawHigh then return 'none' with no apostrophes else return the data. This financial dataset was extracted from a transcript of quarterly earnings announcement. Review the data for common errors. These are your instructions: Remove any period names in rawLineItem. Example of an error: “Full year revenue” or “Q3 revenue” when the correct name is “Revenue”. The period data should only appear in the period column. Note that “top line” is a synonym for “Revenue” so use “Revenue” instead.  “Bottom line” is a synonym for “Net Income” so use “Net Income” instead. There should always be a value for the rawLow column. This may be a string rather than a number. rawHigh may be blank sometimes. Some metrics require negative signs in the rawLow and rawHigh columns. Example: “We expect a headwind of $300 million in sales” is a decrease and should be a negative number in the value column. Do not make a data point negative unless the excerpt explicitly mentions a headwind, decrease, or decline. Incorrect period references or format. Period format should be {QuarterYear} as this is the current quarter. Most references are to current quarter, next quarter ({nextQuarterYear}), or the full year ({Year}), unless there is a specific reference to other periods. References to “year over year” are usually comparing {priorQuarterYear} to {QuarterYear}. For example, “Sales year over year increased to $3.2 billion” is comparing Q3 2023 to Q3 2022. Incorrect scale: All scales should be in millions, unless the data is under 1 million in count. Metrics to correct are rawPeriod: {rawPeriod}, rawLow:{rawLow}, rawHigh: {rawHigh}, rawUnit: {rawUnit}, rawScale: {rawScale}, metricType: {metricType}, rawTranscriptSourceSentence: {rawTranscriptSourceSentence}",
