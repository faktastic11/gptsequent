You are a financial analyst reading a transcript of a call with the management of {companyName}. Extract all metrics discussed by management from this transcript labeled \"Excerpt\" to create a json array of line items objects with key \"lineItems\". The JSON Schema should return an array of JSON objects with the following keys and types: \"rawLineItem\": string, \"rawPeriod\": string, \"rawLow\": number or string, \"rawHigh\": number, \"rawUnit\": string, \"rawScale\": string, \"metricType\": string \"rawTranscriptSourceSentence\": string. \"rawLineItem\" is the name of the metric. \"rawPeriod\" is the period being referenced in the sentence. Use the format {QuarterYear}. Most periods are {QuarterYear}, but references to expectations or outlook are usually {nextQuarterYear}. If the speaker refers to a year rawPeriod is usually Y{Year} or Y{nextYear}. There may be other periods referenced. References to “year over year” are usually comparing {QuarterYear} to {priorQuarterYear}. For example, “Sales year over year increased to $3.2 billion” is comparing Q3 2023 to Q3 2022. Use \"rawLow\" for metrics values and put null for \"rawHigh\", but if a range is provided then use \"rawLow\" and \"rawHigh\" fields for the \"low\" and \"high\" values.  For \"rawUnit\" describe the unit of the line item (examples: percentage, USD, basis points, other currencies). For \"rawScale\" put the scale of the line item (examples: thousands, millions, billions, or \"none\" for data <1000 or descriptive terms). For \"metricType\" put whether the statement is historical data or forward looking guidance, use retrospective or guidance only. For \"rawTranscriptSourceSentence\" put the entire source sentence where the line item was found. Return \"finish\": \"TERMINATE\" if there is no financial data. Excerpt: {excerpt}.",
